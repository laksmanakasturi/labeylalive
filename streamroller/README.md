Streamroller is a mutlistream tool that allows you to broadcast your streams (e.g OBS/Xsplit) to multiple platforms such as Twitch, Youtube, and Facebook at once. It also has read only chat to make it easy to vocally respond to your viewers in a single window.

This tool is meant to be hosted remotely to avoid networking issues locally as trying to stream for multiple sources can get quite heavy.

## Getting Keys/Tokens

Before installing to make the setup simpler, it's best to get all the keys and tokens you'll need from your accounts first. Not every platform is required, only keys and tokens for the platforms you wish to stream to. See the [SERVICES.md](SERVICES.md) doc.

## Install

### Docker Cloud

[![Deploy to Docker Cloud](https://files.cloud.docker.com/images/deploy-to-dockercloud.svg)](https://cloud.docker.com/stack/deploy/?repo=https://github.com/dustinblackman/streamroller)

Docker Cloud is users who are atleast somewhat familiar with working on servers. You can follow Docker Cloud's get started guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/getting-started/intro_cloud/), and then afterwards hit the Deploy with Cloud button.

### Docker

A docker image is available over at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dustinblackman/streamroller). It's suggested to use a [tag](https://hub.docker.com/r/dustinblackman/streamroller/tags/) rather then `latest`.

### Server

Grab the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/dustinblackman/streamroller/releases) page, or build from source and install directly from master. Streamroller is currently built and tested against Go 1.8.

__Quick install for Linux:__
```
curl -Ls "https://github.com/dustinblackman/streamroller/releases/download/1.0.0/streamroller-linux-amd64-1.0.0.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /usr/local/bin/
```

__Build From Source:__

A makefile exists to handle all things needed to build and install from source.

```
git pull https://github.com/dustinblackman/streamroller
cd streamroller
make install
```

## Configure

Configuration can be done either by command line parameters, environment variables, or a JSON file. Please see all available flags with `streamroller --help` or in the example below.

To set a configuration, you can take the flag name and export it in your environment or save in one of the three locations for config files.

After launch, chat can be found on the index, (e.g `http://localhost:8080`). And streams can also be submitted to index (e.g `rtmp://localhost:8080`).
